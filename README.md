Korean Language Processing at University of British Columbian (Vancouver, Canada)


## POS tagging 
We obtain 99.88% f1 score for token segmentation and 94.77% accuracy for POS tagging for Sejong tag sets (best published result)(https://github.com/jungyeul/sjmorph) [[park-tyers:2019:LAW](https://aclanthology.org/W19-4022/)]

## Constituent parsing
We train and evaluate the phrase structure Sejong treebank using statistical and neural parsing systems and obtain results up to a 89.18 f1 score (best published result) [[kim-park:2022](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering/article/abs/note-on-constituent-parsing-for-korean/5ED4C32114B83971B13054A97D4004A9)]

## Dependency parsing
The proposed morphUD outperforms parsing results for all Korean UD treebanks [[chen-EtAl:2022:COLING](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.482)]
