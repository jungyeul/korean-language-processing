## 1. POS tagging 
We obtain 99.88% f1 score for token segmentation and 94.77% accuracy for POS tagging for Sejong tag sets (best published result)(https://github.com/jungyeul/sjmorph) [[park-tyers:2019:LAW](https://aclanthology.org/W19-4022/)]

## 2. Syntactic parsing including CCG and TAG parsing
We train and evaluate the phrase structure Sejong treebank using statistical and neural parsing systems and obtain results up to a 89.18 f1 score (best published result) [[kim-park:2022](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering/article/abs/note-on-constituent-parsing-for-korean/5ED4C32114B83971B13054A97D4004A9)]

## 3. Morpheme-based approach
### Dependency parsing
The proposed morphUD outperforms parsing results for all Korean UD treebanks [[chen-EtAl:2022:COLING](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.482)]

### NER
Morpheme-based NER [(under review)]

### FrameNet parsing
Morpheme-based FrameNet parsing [(coming soon)]

## 4. Unimorph
Morphological paradigms and segmentation [(coming soon), https://unimorph.github.io]

## 5. VerbNet
Korean VerbNet [(coming soon)]
